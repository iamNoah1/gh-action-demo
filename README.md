# GitHub Action Demo
Super simple braindead example of a custom GitHub Action written in Golang. Could have been written in any other language as the action runs a Docker Container. 

See [this file](./action.yaml) representing the definition of the action and [this example](.github/workflows/example.yaml) to see an example usage of the action.
